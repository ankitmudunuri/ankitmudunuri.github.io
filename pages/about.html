  <div class="about-content">
    <p class="aboutme">
      Hi, my name is Ankit Mudunuri! As stated on the homepage, I am a recent graduate from
      Michigan State University, where I earned my Bachelors in Engineering with a major in Computer Science
      and a minor in Business. 
      The fields of computer science that I am most interested in are cybersecurity
      and artificial intelligence/machine learning, more specifically low-level systems 
      and networking-related topics in the cybersecurity space, as well the fields of cognitive AI 
      and object perception. My main focus is to bridge the gap between cybersecurity and AI/ML
      by finding ways to utilize machine learning in helping to secure systems and prevent threats,
      as well as securing machine learning models and preventing bad actors from causing harm, such
      as inserting malicious data into training data or causing purposeful hallucinations.
    </p>

    <p class="aboutme">
      To start, I grew up in a setting that truly fostered my love for engineering, ranging 
      from the contraptions I built with Legos all the way to the times that I interrupted my 
      dad's work meetings to show him that I ripped apart the electronics of my RC car. The 
      sci-fi media I was exposed to around this time also definitely played a vital role in this, as 
      I used to watch movies like Tron: Legacy and Bladerunner or watch playthroughs on YouTube 
      of games like Deus Ex (yes, I know it might sound corny or nerdy as an inspiration but I still love it). This love 
      then led me to joining a robotics team, more specifically in the FIRST Robotics Circuit, which 
      helped me learn about the engineering process and how a product can go from a design on a piece 
      of paper all the way to a complex functioning mechanism. This program also helped me understand 
      the basic scientific concepts needed for engineering, such as physics and chemistry, which originally 
      did push me more towards becoming a mechanical engineer.
    </p>

    <p class="aboutme">
      Later on, though, I was introduced to the world of computer science through an after-school club in high school. 
      I had previously coded used Java in middle school robotics, though I hated it, but this club helped 
      introduce me to the concept of "actually enjoying coding". I started by learning HTML and CSS, and later 
      started learning about basic algorithms and how to code in C++. This love for computer science then 
      culminated into an introduction to the workforce through my first internship, where I taught myself Python 
      using online tutorials in order to be ready for the internship. This introduction to Python helped introduce 
      me to the world of AI/ML as well, as the internship allowed me to experiment with some related libraries, such as 
      TensorFlow and Keras. Later on I also started experimenting with systems and networking libraries, which promoted 
      my love for cybersecurity-related topics. Overall, when I look back at it all I could never see myself in my previously 
      imagined role of a mechanical engineer.
    </p>

    <p class="aboutme">
      So, enough about my love for computer science. Alongside all of this, I like to work out and play basketball in my free 
      time. I also like to produce music, giving me another artistic medium to express my creativity through. I also was part 
      of a high school marching band as a drumline member, and still try to practice my skills whenever I get a chance. All of 
      these activities help me relax and hone other skills, rather than sitting at my desktop all day hammering away at the 
      keyboard. They also help me keep in physical and mental shape as well, and help train my discipline and focus as a side effect.
    </p>

    <p class="aboutme" style="padding-bottom: 4rem;">
      So this is all about me. I still strive to be the best engineer that I can every single day, and I am always pursuing 
      new knowledge in my fields of interest. I am also always open to meet and work with new people, so please do contact me if you 
      want to work on anything or just simply want to chat. Thank you for reading this!
