    <p class="aboutme">Hi, my name is Ankit Mudunuri! As stated on the homepage, I am currently a sophomore majoring in Computer Science at Michigan State University. 
        The fields of computer science that I am most interested in are artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, more specifically the fields of cognitive
        AI and object perception, as well as low-level systems and networking-related topics in the cybersecurity space (though I am just starting to branch out into this field). 
    </p>

    <p class="aboutme" style="padding-top: 2%;">To start, I grew up in a setting that truly fostered my love for engineering, ranging from the contraptions I built with
                                         Legos all the way to the times that I interrupted my dad's work meetings to show him that I ripped apart the electronics 
                                         of my RC car. The media I was exposed to around this time also definitely played a vital role in this, as I used to watch movies like 
                                         Tron: Legacy and Bladerunner or watch playthroughs on YouTube of games like Deus Ex. This love then led me to joining a robotics team, 
                                         more specifically in the FIRST Robotics Circuit, which helped me learn about the engineering process and how a product can go from a design 
                                         on a piece of paper all the way to a complex functioning mechanism.
    </p>
    <p class="aboutme" style="padding-top: 2%;">Later on I was introduced to the world of computer science through an after-school club in high school. I had previously coded used Java
                                        in middle school robotics, though I hated it, but this club helped introduce me to the concept of "actually enjoying coding". I started by
                                        learning HTML and CSS, and later started learning about basic algorithms and how to code in C++. This love for computer science then culminated
                                        into an introduction to the workforce through my first internship, where I taught myself Python using online tutorials in order to be ready for 
                                        the internship. This introduction to Python helped introduce me to the world of AI as well, as the internship allowed me to experiment with some
                                        of the libraries, such as TensorFlow and Keras. Later on I also started experimenting with systems and networking libraries, which promoted my love
                                        for cybersecurity-related topics. Overall, when I look back at it all I can never see myself in my previously imagined role of a mechanical engineer.     
    </p>
    <p class="aboutme" style="padding-top: 2%;">So, enough about my love for computer science. Alongside all of this, I like to work out and play basketball in my free time. I also like to produce music,
        giving me another artistic medium to express my creativity through. I also was part of a high school marching band as a drumline member, and still try to practice my skills whenever I get
        a chance. All of these activities help me relax and hone other skills, rather than sitting at my desktop all day hammering away at the keyboard. They also help me keep in physical and mental shape as well,
        helping train my discipline and focus as a side effect.
    </p>
    <p class="aboutme" style="padding-top: 2%; padding-bottom:5%;">So this is all about me. I still strive to be the best computer scientist that I can every single day, and I am always pursuing new knowledge in my fields of interest. 
                                                I am also always open to meet and work with new people, so please do contact me if you want to work on anything or just simply want to chat. Thank you for reading this!
