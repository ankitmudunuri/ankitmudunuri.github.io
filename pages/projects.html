          This app is a personal project that was my gateway into learning Rust. I had seen a lot of internet buzz
          about Rust being the "language of the future" and such, so I decided to create a project in order to learn 
          as I developed the app.
        </p>
        <p class="project-text">
          The app is essentially a local-hosted password manager for Windows (as of now). It uses the command shell 
          to interface with the app, and allows you to do 4 basic tasks: add login credentials to the manager and search for,
          update, and remove credentials based on the domain given. The main privacy gimmick of this app is that it also encrypts
          and decrypts the entire password bank and main login credentials using the Argon2 library in Rust, further securing all
          of the stored data in the off-chance that the device is compromised. I am planning to add a feature that utilizes a trained 
          Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM RNN, also dang that is a mouthful) model to estimate how strong the password 
          given is on a scale from 0-4 (hence the "AI" part of the name). 
          
        </p>
        <p class="project-text">
          My reasoning to make it locally
          hosted is because I feel as though it is more private and secure, as it eliminates any external factors such
          as cloud services and the idea of storing passwords in another company's servers/storage. I also decided to go
          with the Command Line Interface (CLI) as the user interface, as opposed to a graphical interface, because I 
          felt like it truly encapsulated the idea that you are in complete control of your own data, where nothing is abstracted
          by a colorful or complicated GUI button (and also because I didn't want to have to learn a whole new app development
          framework hahaha). But overall this project was fun to start, and I will keep working on it until I can finish all the features I promised!

          This was a project that I challenged myself with to practice quick coding.
          I gave myself 1.5 hours to plan and create it, which helped me practice reading
          documentation for Selenium and the Google Sheets API without relying on external 
          tutorials.
        </p>
        <p class="project-text">
          The script aggregates jobs on LinkedIn (based on a search keyword) into a 
          spreadsheet for streamlined application tracking. Next steps include creating 
          a user-friendly UI and handling Google account tokens for any user.
