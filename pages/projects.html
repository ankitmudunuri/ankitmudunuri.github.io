          This script suite was a project that I did to further practice network security fundamentals, as well as get
          some practice with things like Snort parsing and rules, as well as capturing network traffic and categorizing it
          based on its characteristics. It also helped me practice load balancing and different data processing techniques.
        </p>
        <p class="project-text">
          The script is essentially a multi-threaded NIDS (network intrusion detection system) that uses DBSCAN (density-based spatial clustering with noise)
          clustering in order to gather all traffic to and from the system it is ran on and classify it with the cluster that it most
          likely belongs to. It dynamically changes clusters and tries to filter out noise (due to a bunch of different packets from multiple
          sources), showly creating a map of all clusters and all sent/received packets. It then dynamically assigns certain clusters as "suspicious"
          based on relative cluster size and activity. It is definitely faulty as of now, but it is a proof-of-concept. Some ways to make this much
          more accurate is to add more features, such as the content of the packets, which could potentially be a fix I make in the future.

          This app is a personal project that was my gateway into learning Rust. I had seen a lot of internet buzz
          about Rust being the "language of the future" and such, so I decided to create a project in order to learn 
          as I developed the app.
        </p>
        <p class="project-text">
          The app is essentially a local-hosted password manager for Windows (as of now). It uses the command shell 
          to interface with the app, and allows you to do 4 basic tasks: add login credentials to the manager and search for,
          update, and remove credentials based on the domain given. The main privacy gimmick of this app is that it also encrypts
          and decrypts the entire password bank and main login credentials using the Argon2 library in Rust, further securing all
          of the stored data in the off-chance that the device is compromised. It also utilizes a trained CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
          to estimate the strength of passwords to give you a better judgement on what passwords are more susceptible to cracks (I plan on changing
          this to an LSTN RNN in the future to improve the accuracy of estimates). 
          
        </p>
        <p class="project-text">
          My reasoning to make it locally
          hosted is because I feel as though it is more private and secure, as it eliminates any external factors such
          as cloud services and the idea of storing passwords in another company's servers/storage. I also decided to go
          with the Command Line Interface (CLI) as the user interface, as opposed to a graphical interface, because I 
          felt like it truly encapsulated the idea that you are in complete control of your own data, where nothing is abstracted
          by a colorful or complicated GUI button (and also because I didn't want to have to learn a whole new app development
          framework hahaha). But overall this project was fun to start, and I will keep working on it until I can finish all the features I promised!

          This app is a project that me and three other team members undertook for the University of Michigan MHacks 16 Hackathon in the Fall semester
          of 2023. This was built in Python 
        </p>
        <p class="project-text">
          The basic gist of this app is that it creates subtitles for video feeds of people talking and tracks those subtitles to the person's face. It does this via the use of
          OpenCV in Python to track the person's face with a bounding box, as well as place the subtitles underneath, and it also used to utilize the Google Cloud API for Google Speech-To-Text
          and Google Translate (now it doesn't anymore, it just uses Python packages to do all of it locally). This app was also multithreaded to speed up conversion for live-time translation, 
          so we had one thread processing the video feed to get the bounding box of the person's face, one thread for audio capture, one thread for speech-to-text, another thread for text translation, 
          and a final thread to create an overlay mesh with the converted text on top of the video stream.
          
        </p>
        <p class="project-text">
          Some challenges that we ran into during the 24 hours of the hackathon was figuring out how to get the Google Cloud API working with authentication and using the credits that were given to us
          for the hackathon. Once we finally figured out how to get that all running we ran into another problem of how we were going to communicate data between the threads in the pipeline. Our solution
          to this was using thread-safe queues between each thread in the pipeline, as that was the only way we could think of doing this at the time. The final problem that we ran into was bottlenecking
          at certain points in the pipeline. For example, the subsequent requests and responses from the Google Cloud API took a long time due to travel time and distance of each request and response, as well
          as the bad Wi-Fi in the building we were in. Unfortunately we did not get to fix this, partially because we also were trying to make our project qualify for the "Best use of Google Cloud" award, but
          we later removed the use of Google Cloud and replaced it with Python libraries that do all of the data conversion locally. This mitigated the delay and bottlenecking of the program quite a bit, finally
          making it run how we intended it to (mostly). Overall this was a truly fun experience, and helped all of us in the team learn how to work together and keep sane while under pressure to finish a project 
          in a constrained amount of time.

          This was a project that I challenged myself with to practice quick coding.
          I gave myself 1.5 hours to plan and create it, which helped me practice reading
          documentation for Selenium and the Google Sheets API without relying on external 
          tutorials.

        <p class="project-text">
          The script aggregates jobs on LinkedIn (based on a search keyword) into a 
          spreadsheet for streamlined application tracking. Next steps include creating 
          a user-friendly UI and handling Google account tokens for any user.
