        <p class="experience-text">
          This is my current job. I work at the Stellantis North American headquarters located 
          in Auburn Hills, MI. Some of the things I got to work on included:
          <ul>
            <li>Plugins in the Voxel51 FiftyOne API for Python, which involved having to create a way for the API to read in 3D LiDAR sensor
                data, that was collected during data collection driving sessions for L3 ADAS (Level 3 Advanced Driver Assistance Systems), and 
                visualize it. This allows for efficient data filtration when training efficient machine learning models for ADAS.
            </li>
            <li>A pipeline of custom Python and Bash scripts in Linux that allowed our team to extract metadata from data collection sessions and 
                check if the sensors had the proper data collection rates (if they were actually reading in data). I also had to utilize SSH and PySpark
                in order to connect to the servers housing the data so that I could extract the metadata and push it onto the AWS S3 buckets that hosted
                more data. 
            </li>
            <li>A Python GUI script in Databricks to get hexadecimal messages, generated by the ECU of a car, that pertain to 12V battery statuses and
                creating/linking more scripts that preprocess those messages in binary to check the statuses and attributes of the battery.
            </li>
          </ul>

          Overall, this internship was a lot of fun and taught me a lot about data pipelines, as well as CI/CD pipelines
          for software services, and how to interface with vehicle sensor data and the such. It also helped me understand
          how to go about preprocessing and filtering data in order to train the most efficient machine learning models possible.

        <p class="experience-text">
          This was my second internship, and is also my current part-time internship. I had worked on:
          <ul>
            <li>
                A way to communicate between Siemens HMIs and Rockwell PLCs via RS Logix 5000 and the Siemens TIA Portal, as well as Bash scripts.
                This would negate the need for completely having to replace all Rockwell systems during migration towards Siemens systems in assembly plants.
            </li>
            <li>
                A Python GUI application that converted VBA (Visual Basic Advanced) classes to PHP classes. This utilized RegEx (Regular Expressions) pattern
                matching, and was made in order to mitigate the time needed to manually convert every single class to PHP
            </li>
            <li>
                A login/user page using PHP classes that allowed you to add, remove, and edit user permissions for changing the text on an LED sign. The sign is
                connected to a Raspberry Pi that hosts this page via Nginx.
            </li>
            <li>
                Installing and configuring Avast Business Antivirus onto Siemens CRWs, as well as locking down the OS and creating technical documentation on how to do this.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fixing Python apps for ADP Sign Message Protocol Generation and Sending
            </li>
          </ul>
          This internship introduced me to a plethora of things in the software world. It gave me the opportunity to learn about the hardware side of things, like how computers
          interface with physical sensors, as well as teaching me how to write technical documentation for engineering. It also introduced me to the security side of things, thus
          starting my interest in cybersecurity.

        <p class="experience-text">
          This was my first internship, the one that really got me interested in computer science. The first time I helped work on:
          <ul>
            <li>A computer vision-assited anomaly detection script in Python for an assembly line. This script essentially
                took pictures of parts on an assembly line and could identify defects in the part in order to diagnose if 
                the part was faulty or not, and divert it before it got to the vehicle assembly stage. 
            </li>
          </ul>
          The second time around, during my third internship, I got to work on the following projects:
          <ul>
            <li>Preprocessing assembly line image and infrared data of objects and researching the best method of training neural network
                models in order to generate 3D point cloud models of the data, which also required me to implement depth estimation
                while training the model. 
            </li>
            <li>A script in Python for SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) communcation between Siemens equipment. This allowed
                for seamless and easy CLI management of all Siemens equipment that are connected together on a production network.
            </li>
          </ul>
          This internship will always hold a special place in my heart, as it was the first internship that I had gotten and essentially
          nudged me into going towards the field of computer science.
